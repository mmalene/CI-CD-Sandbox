## 1.08 BILLING_ACCOUNT

The Billing Account (BAN) is the main entity that monitors the billing, A/R and collection activities for the customer. A BAN is created when a customer contacts the Telecommunications Company and wishes to purchase services. The BAN remains active for as long as there is a business relationship between the Telecommunications Company and the customer. The BAN entity also maintains the A/R balance and collection status.
Special BANs (not customer-related) are used to hold information on undefined payments. In this case, the BAN is called an Exception Control account, and is not related to a customer.
Abbreviations for the table:
-	R (responsibility) - indicates which application is responsible for each attribute
-	A - A/R attribute
-	B - Billing attribute
-	C - Collection attribute
-	G - General attribute (CSM)


The Customer and the BAN entities have the same key values, i.e., BAN = CUSTOMER_ID.
The two entities share the same type: BAN Type in the Customer Type in the Customer entity, and the BAN Sub Type BL_SPCL_BAN_CODE in the BAN table.
The BAN Status is also applicable for the Customer entity.

## 1.10 COLLECTION_STATUS

The Collection-Status entity stores the debt of each BAN, divided into ageing buckets. The entity contains the buckets for three days: the run-date and two days later.
It also includes the BAN’s unbilled revenue (unbilled calls and charges).
Note: In systems working in Invoice Level Collection mode, this entity would be empty.

## 1.12 CREDIT_DEBIT_LINK

The Credit Debit Link entity represents the results of the cash and credit application. It defines how the payments and "account level" adjustments are applied to the various BAN Invoice Items and, in cases of overpayment, to the BAN's credit balance.

## 1.17 INVOICE_ITEM
An Invoice Item entity represents the account’s debits and their current status. It accumulates all charges of the same type that were debited to the billing account within an event. The entity is created whenever the billing account is debited with new charges.
The invoice item also represents credits and account level adjustments. In these cases, the total charge amount is negative.
The debits and credits of the system are segregated according to the invoice type and tax code. Separate invoice items are generated for charges of different invoice types and tax codes in order to enable prioritisation (for the Deposit Invoice type, a separate Invoice Item is created for every Deposit Charge). For each type of charge, the appropriate invoice type is defined in the Charge Information table. Examples of various invoice types are service debits and deposit debits.
The invoice item entity contains summary information for the charges grouped under it and information common to all these charges. This information includes the charges’ due dates, total amounts, payment statuses, deposit information, etc.
Although the Related Charge and Invoice Item entities contain some overlapping data, both entities are utilized to increase the efficiency of routine financial activities. Thus, the most common A/R activities performed on the account involve the invoice item entity only, while the charge entity information is primarily used when amounts need to be displayed or reported in a detailed manner.

## 1.19 MANUAL_NOTE_REQUEST

This table holds all immediate Adjustments and Charges created by the CSRs. All Immediate Adjustments and Charges created during the day are kept in the Manual Note Request. A nightly process invoices them all together, reports the revenue to the GL, and produces a Credit Note for the Adjustments and a Debit Note for the Charges.
If Immediate Adjustments were created to charges that belong to different Invoices, a separate Credit Note is created for each related Invoice.

## 1.20 PAYMENT
The Payment entity represents all payments sent by customers to cover their debts.
Most of the payments enter the system in files from the Bank Clearing House.
These files are examined by the Payment Receipt process to ensure that they are complete. Upon arrival, each payment is checked by the Payment Posting process and is posted to the relevant BAN. A new entry is created within the Payment entity upon completion of this process.
Each entry in the Payment entity is related to a specific BAN. If a Payment is transferred to a different BAN, the transfer is recorded in a Payment_Activity record and a new Payment entity is created for the new BAN.
Each entry contains basic information about the payment, such as payment details (bank account no, etc.), related BAN, receipt information, etc.
Further information on payments can be found in the Payment Activity and Credit Debit Link entities. The Payment Activity entity records all activities performed on a payment, such as newly-posted payments, backouts and fund transfers. The Credit Debit Link entity records the payment distributed among the various BAN debts.
Direct debit payments are held in a special repository and do not affect the Payment entity until their due date.

## 1.23 PAYMENT_CONTROL

The Payment Control table keeps track of Payment Receipt files sent from different sources and received by the Payment/Statement Receipt process.
Each source has an entry in this table.
When a Payment Receipt file is received, it is checked against the relevant entry (according to the source) in the Payment Control table in order to avoid receiving the same file twice or missing a file.
Once the Payment Receipt file has completed its checking process, the Payment Control file is updated accordingly.

## 1.24 PROOF_AND_BALANCE

The Proof and Balance entity maintains all financial activities that affect the system balances (the Service, Write Off and Unidentified balances) during a particular day. 
A P&B activity represents the way in which an A/R activity, with its specific characteristics (the A/R breakdown), is displayed in the P&B reports.
An entry in the Proof and Balance entity is the total daily effect of a P&B activity on the system balances. All the activities performed on the Proof and Balance entity relate to a group of entries such as all daily entries or all monthly entries. The smallest group referenced is all entries for a specific day.

## 2.01 AC_SOURCE

This SEMI application table contains information about each source in the Pre-processor system.  Only LAST_CYCLE_PROCD, NEXT_CYCLE_EXPECT and FILE_SEQ_NO are updated by the application.  All other fields contain reference values that remain constant.
The table has a constant number of entries, which are divided into two types of fields.  The first type is static or permanent; the second is dynamic and is updated with current data by the application.
The table must be populated before the MAF Pre-processor system starts running.

## 2.02 AC_PHYSICAL_FILES
This application table contains information regarding to physical data entered into MPS.  All physical files relate to sources (one source to many physical files).
Each physical input data set creates an entry in the physical table.  The physical header, physical trailer and other information are updated in the table’s entries when the physical data set is processed.
For Incollect, Outcollect and Service_Provider’s output files, this table and the Ac_Roam_Files table are both updated.

## 2.03 AC_ROAM_FILES
This application table contains statistical information regarding to roam physical files entered into and exited from MPS (Incollect / Outcollect / Service_Provider) for reporting purposes.  Each entry in this table represents information of roam physical file, that its basic information maintained in Ac_Physical_Files table (same key and also some other information to facilitate the roaming reports jobs, when approaching to this table only).
Each roam physical file creates an entry in this table (along with Ac_Processing_Accounting and Ac_Physical_Files tables).  The MAF process updates these entries when the roam physical data set is processed.

## 2.04 AC_PROCESSING_ACCOUNTING
The Processing Accounting control table is the backbone of the A&C tables. It is the central table for controlling programs and files in the Message Processing System (MPS). The table tracks information on files that have been processed. When a file is successfully created, filled and closed by a process, a new entry is opened in the table.


### 2.04.1 Table Function
The Processing Accounting control table performs the following functions:
-	Identifies the dataset name.
-	Identifies the dataset's creation date and time.
-	Identifies the program start date and time.
-	Identifies all the input and output files of the process.
-	Tracks all the files in the system.
-	Records statistical information and the execution status for each program of a specific file, and allows for a follow-up of the file and process.
-	Gives the identification of the job number.
-	Identifies the current program name and current FILE_ALIAS that created the dataset.
-	Identifies the origin dataset.
-	Identifies the physical and logical file.
-	records the following statistical processing information for a file and program:
    - Record quantity.
    - Time_usage quantity.
    - Money value quantity.
    - Program error record quantity.

## 2.05 TNT_STATISTICAL_CODES
This is the configuration table for statistical codes.  Each row in this table contains details of one statistical value.  The statistical code points to the position of the counter in the TNT_STATISTICAL_TABLE table.  Each row in the table contains up to 200 counters. Each set of counters can have up to 600 counters, so one set can be spread on multiple rows.  The position of the counter is defined by two values:
- 42	Row number:	Defines the row number of a counter set.


  Row number = (STATISTICAL_CODE / 200) + 1



- 43	position:	Defines the name (VALUE_XXX) of the column.


  position = STATISTICAL_CODE - (200 × (row number - 1))


For example, if statistical code = 205, then


Row number = 2.


position = 5 (column name is VALUE_005).

## 2.07 TNT_NORMAL
This table maintains statistical information in normalised form: one row per counter instead of 200 counters in a row.  This enables simple access by report generators such as FOCUS to the statistical information.
The data in this table is converted from the statistical table by the TNTNormal service for requested selection criteria.

## 2.08 TNT_LIMITS_TABLE
This SEMI application table contains initialisations for threshold/tolerance checks of statistical values (the values can be updated by the application according to the statistical results).
After modifying an entry in this table, the user can save the definition of the previous limits and create a new version.  The previous version is marked as not active in the ACTIVATION_FLAG field.  Any of the limits’ header data fields that are not relevant to a specific statistical code is left NULL and ignored.  The table is linked to the TNT_STATISTICAL_TABLE by its key fields.

# 3. Billing Area Entities
Link to original documentation: https://itwiki.atlassian.teliacompany.net/display/DID/Fokus+documentation
  - Document: 
     - Billing Area Entities_v16.doc 


## 3.01 Bill Table
The Bill Entity represents the bills produced for the Billing Account. It enables the system to uniquely identify each bill and link the bill with its components.
Each bill is uniquely identified by a system-generated number. The Bill dates are not necessarily the date of the cycle, as the customer may request a final bill. In such cases, more than one bill may be produced during the month.
Bill information for the BAN level is maintained in the Bill entity. Bill information from the subscriber level is stored in the Bill CTN entity. 
All the amounts in Bill table includes tax.
The table is to be partitioned by ROOT_BAN field.

## 3.01.1 Life Cycle
The Bill Entity is linked to the Billing Account Number (BAN). 
When CSM creates a new BAN, two bills are opened: The current and the next.
During production of the bills, the current BILL is closed, the next BILL becomes current, and a new next BILL is created. 
During the billed period -- the period that is covered by the bill -- all new calls, payments, immediate charges, and adjustments are related to the current BILL.
In cases of Revised Final billing a revised bill is not sent to the customer unless there was any activity or the balance is not zero (e.g., late arrival of Roaming calls, Last Bill was not fully paid).
In case of a write-off (W/O), a bill is also produced , but not sent to the customer.

## 3.02 Bill History Table
Since the Bill table is a large table, once in a while a part of the records in Bill table are transferred to the Bill History table.
The structure of this entity is the same as the Bill Entity.
The Bill history table is to be partitioned by period coverage end date.


<br />
<br />



## 3.03 Bill Product Table
The Bill Product Entity is linked to the Bill entity. The table holds tOtaling for each product (LoCS) of the BAN. Each record is related to a bill record.
All the amounts in Bill Product table includes the tax amount.
The table is to be partitioned by ROOT_BAN field.

### 3.02.1 Life Cycle
The Bill Product Entity is linked to a bill record. For each Bill record there can be one or more than one record in Bill Product . The ratio depends on the number of products which are related to the BAN.
When billing closes the current bill new records are created in Bill Product table. One record is created for each product (LoCS) of the BAN.

## 3.04 Bill Product History Table
Since the Bill Product table is a large table , once in a while a part of the records in Bill Product table are transferred to the Bill Product History table.

The structure of this entity is the same as the Bill Product Entity.

The Bill Product history table is to be partitioned according to the partitioning of Bill table.



<br />
<br />



## 3.05 Bill CTN Table
The Bill CTN entity contains information at the subscriber level for a specific bill. 

The Bill CTN Entity is linked to the appropriate Bill entity. It is created for each subscriber of the specific bill during the Billing run. 

The Bill entity contains summarised information for all subscribers of the specific BAN, and there is a separate Bill CTN entity for each of the subscribers.

The entity is built by Billing during the Bill Day run.

All the amounts in Bill CTN table include the tax amount.

The table is to be partitioned by ROOT_BAN field.

## 3.09 Charge History Table
Since the Charge table is a large table , once in a while a part of the records in Charge table are transferred to the Charge History table.
The structure of this entity is the same as the Charge Entity.
The charge history table is to be partitioned by period coverage end date.

## 3.10 Ban List Table
The BAN LIST table is created by Bill Preparation every bill day. The table contains, for each BAN processed by BN, additional information (to that already in the BILL table), that is required for BILL Production purposes.
Note:
All the attributes' values are assigned in the table by the 'new balance calculation' monitor of BN, and are never updated. Therefore, there is no life cycle clause for each individual attribute, except where there is special information about the attribute's life cycle.

## 3.14 QA Profile Table
These are intermediate temporary tables that are used by the QA process. They contain information regarding the customers that were selected for QA. The QA profile table contains the general QA information about a selected customer, such as whether this account is requested for the current QA run. The QA Profile Group contains the detailed results of the QA criteria tests that were applied to the accounts (i.e., Customer relevancy for the various QA parameter groups as in the QA parameter tables).
These table are used in the following processes: 

-	Output from the preparation of the QA candidates pool.
  The criteria test performed for the customers that are processed in the QA is kept in the QA profile and in the QA Profile Group.
-	An input file for the QA final selection phase.
  The QA process extracts the best combination of BANs for the final QA BAN list from this account list.
-	Input for QA reports production.
